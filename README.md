This Password Generator is a basic tool created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to generate random passwords with various lengths and character types.

The Password Generator uses a simple algorithm to generate random passwords. It does not store or save any passwords, and all generated passwords are unique and cannot be replicated.

The user interface is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use. Users can select the length of the password and choose which character types to include (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters).

Please note that while this Password Generator can be useful for generating passwords for non-sensitive accounts, it is not recommended to use it for sensitive accounts or information. For more secure password management, we recommend using a trusted password manager.

The code for this Password Generator is available on GitHub for review and improvement. Contributions and feedback are welcome.
